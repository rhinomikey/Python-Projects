########################################################################
#
# DONE: 2.
#   READ this comment, ASKING QUESTIONS as needed to understand it.
#
#   For objects that are CONSTRUCTED, we use the DOT notation
#   to ask them to do things or to change their characteristics.
#   For example:
#      nadia = rg.SimpleTurtle()
#      nadia.pen = rg.Pen('blue', 1)
#      nadia.forward(100)
#
#   In the above example:
#
#      pen      is an   INSTANCE VARIABLE   (aka DATA ATTRIBUTE, FIELD)
#                 of SimpleTurtles.  It is a CHARACTERISTIC of
#                 SimpleTurtles. Each SimpleTurtle has its own VALUE
#                 of that characteristic.
#
#      forward  is a   METHOD   (aka FUNCTION ATTRIBUTE)
#                 of SimpleTurtles.  It is something that any
#                 SimpleTurtle can DO.  It is just like a FUNCTION
#                 except for details about the way that it is called.
#
#   The statement
#        nadia.forward(100)
#   CALLS the   forward   METHOD on nadia, sending that method
#   the number 100 and making the method run (execute).
#
#   We   ** define **   FUNCTIONS to give NAMES to blocks of code.
#   For example:
#
#      def turtle3():
#          maja = rg.SimpleTurtle()
#          maja.pen = rg.Pen('green', 10)
#          maja.paint_bucket = rg.PaintBucket('black')
#            ...
#
#   We   ** call **   FUNCTIONS (that is, we make them run)
#   in a way that is similar to how we call METHODS,
#   but WITHOUT the DOT notation.
#
#   For example, we make the code in the definition of  main  execute
#   (run) by using the statement:
#       main()
#   and we make the code in the definition of  print  execute,
#   sending it the string 'Hello Rose' by using:
#       print('Hello Rose')
#
#   No dot -- just the name of the function, parentheses, and
#   the information (if any) the function needs.
#
#   SUMMARY:
#   Suppose that we have the statement:
#        bilbo = rg.SimpleTurtle()
#   Then:
#     -- If   draw_many_squares   is a FUNCTION,
#        then we can CALL that FUNCTION by a statement like:
#             draw_many_squares(bilbo, 9, 100, 30)
#
#     -- If   draw_square   is a METHOD,
#        then we can CALL that METHOD by a statement like:
#             bilbo.draw_square(100)
#
#     ** ASK QUESTIONS if you are unclear about any of the above. **
#
#   When you believe you understand the differences and similarities
#   between calling a FUNCTION and calling a METHOD,
#   change the above TODO to DONE.

#   RUN this program.  Then:
#
#     a. Read the green DOC-STRING of the   main   function below.
#        Summarize here, in 10 words or fewer, what does  MAIN  do?
#            Run the functions defined in the program.
#
#        Not HOW it does it.  Not WHY it does it.  Just WHAT it does.
#        (Hint: a suitable answer is   "Calls 3 functions to test them."
#
#
#     b. Read the green DOC-STRING of the   jump_and_move_turtle
#        function below.  Summarize here, in 10 words or fewer,
#        what does  JUMP_AND_MOVE_TURTLE  do?
#            Moves two turtles to two different points.
#
#     c. Read the green DOC-STRINGs of the   draw_many_squares
#        function below.  Summarize here, in 10 words or fewer,
#        what does  DRAW_MANY_SQUARES  do?
#            Draw squares at different angles from the next.
#
#     d. Read the green DOC-STRINGs of the   turtle3
#        function below.  Summarize here, in 10 words or fewer,
#        what does  TURTLE3  do?
#            Creates a simple turtle and has it do things.
#
#   ASK QUESTIONS ** NOW ** if you do not understand WHAT those four
#   functions do.  You are not required to understand HOW they do it;
#   just WHAT they do (as described by their green doc-strings).

#   When you believe you understand WHAT those four functions do,
